    You may be wondering, "Blob, why is the entire page in a div?"
    Good question. To which I answer, "I dunno, felt like it."
    I do, (or maybe I don't I'm writing this before CSS,) use it for some styling in the CSS.

    You may also be wondering, "Why in the world do you have a billion nested divs?"
    To which I answer, ":>"

    UPDATE6: These were all put here at once, and weren't added sequentially, and this one was added last. I'm lying to you by adding numbers.
    UPDATE: I keep adding divs somebody help me I think i'm addicted.
    UPDATE2: Now I'm adding comments, wait what if I put a div in a comment?
    <div>
      UPDATE3: I don't think this is helping.
    </div>
    UPDATE4: That's not even the correct syntax.
    <div>
      <p>UPDATE5: Still not helping</p>

          My real name is ​ <!-- Yes I used zero width spaces here, HTML doesn't like using double spaces on their own. I'm sure there's a better way to do this but I'm too lazy to look it up. -->​ ​<!-- Did you think I'd put my real name here? No, neither did I but I guess here it is, wait no, that's not it.

          I like video games, art, and music. One of which I sometimes make. (It's art.)<br>
          I also make websites sometimes. I use HTML and CSS. <!-- What's the alternative? I guess XHTML exists. --> I've heard mention of some "CoffeeType" thing but it sounds kinda dumb.<br>
          If you talk to me I'll probably tell you to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_Animal" target="_blank">BNA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29" target="_blank">The Princess Bride</a>, if you do that now I won't have to tell you.

        <h2>The S.P.A.C.E.</h2>
        <p>The Severity Prevention and Correction Elite (S.P.A.C.E.) are Sci's own spec ops team. They are responsible for correcting any severe errors caused by interactions of multiple realites. Their methods, however, are not perfect, and may occasionally be seen as "plot holes" in certain media.</p>

        <p>Any attempts to view the future of this individual, whether by subdimensional or superdimensional means, have proven to be ineffective. Additionally, the higher the dimensionality of the attempt, the more force is produced in direct opposion to the attempt.</p>

        <h2>The Boreal</h2>
        <p>We have reason to believe that light is not a substance on it's own, but rather, a state of matter acheivable by anything. The closed eye for the boreal has been aquired in order to gather information regarding this. To avoid confusion, the substance regarded as normal light should instead be called photon.</p>

      <div class="log" id="glass">
        <h2>The GLASS Project</h2>
        <p>The leading members of The GLASS Project are responsible for the development of interspacial travel. Their last status was regarding issues in the stabalization of wormholes, or "flows" in their terminology. Due to such severe deviation from the original intentions of the project, termination of the project is very likely imminent.</p>

        <h2>Ennead</h2>
        <p>Ennead is used to convey information in a manner more efficient for small working spaces. It's primary components are a base rune and, in most cases, a dot, the exact depiction of these does not matter, so long as they're unique. Following is an example of text written with ennead.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/ennead-example.svg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Below is the basis for the construction of most ennead runes.</p>

        <h2>Psi</h2>
        <p>Screw you guys. I don't care if this is professional anymore, but seriously, just, go jump in a wormhole or something. You've done absolutely nothing beneficial at all. <strong>EVER</strong>. "Hey look Sci! We made teleportation!" GREAT! AMAZING! GUESS WHAT! You found something we invented probably aeons before you even existed! No it's not <em>magic</em>. The point of <em>magic</em> is that it CAN'T be explained. It's called superdimensional you nitwits. We know exactly how to control and manipulate the stuff you guys do. Do you listen to us? Noooooo, you just keep doing your tricks claiming it's the "newest" or "greatest" thing. We have eyes on you, we KNOW how useless you are.</p>

      <div class="log" id="eye">
        <h2>The Eyes</h2>
        <p>An eye is an object or entity used by Sci to look into other realities. An eye aware of it's use as an eye should be referred to as open, while an eye not aware of it's use as such should be referred to as closed. Information from eyes is sent back to The Eye of Reality for cataloging and processing. A partial list of eyes follows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The GLASS Project</li>

        <p>Should you believe that one of the enteries incorrectly referrs to you, you will shortly be contacted about being opened.</p>

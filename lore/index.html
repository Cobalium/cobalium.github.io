        <h2>The Eyes</h2>
        <p>An eye is an object or entity used by Sci to look into other realities. An eye aware of its use as an eye should be referred to as open, while an eye not aware of it's use as such should be referred to as closed. Eyes that have been compromised in some manner are referred to as bleeding. Information from eyes is sent back to The Eye of Reality for cataloging and processing. A non-definitive list of eyes follows. They are referred to by their internal name, rather than their common name. Those of the following with related entries are linked.</p>

        <p>The Severity Prevention and Correction Elite (S.P.A.C.E.) are Sci's own spec ops team. They are responsible for correcting any severe errors caused by interactions of multiple realties. Their methods, however, are not perfect, and may occasionally be seen as "plot holes" in certain media.</p>

        <h2>The Boreal</h2>
        <p>We have reason to believe that light is not a substance on it's own, but rather, a state of matter achievable by anything. The closed eye for the boreal has been acquired in order to gather information regarding this. To avoid confusion, the substance regarded as normal light should instead be called photon.</p>

        <p>The leading members of The GLASS Project are responsible for the development of interspatial travel.

Due to such severe deviation from the original intentions of the project, termination of the project is very likely imminent.</p>

        <p>Psi is a corporation aware of our existence, however we have reason to believe that their goals to not entirely align with ours. However, meddling in their affairs may prove detrimental for their base reality, so, as such, they may stay for now. We may consider using the S.P.A.C.E. at some point in the near future.</p>

      <div class="log" id="magic">
        <h2>Superdimensional Physics</h2>
        <p>While looking into various realities, a occurrence common across many, but not all, is that of magic. After study and research we have decided that the distinction between magic and non-magic is better classified as subdimensional and superdimensional. Things that are subdimensional are what you'd expect to see, things that occur within normally accepted laws of physics within  a regular spacial volume. Things that are superdimensional however break these standard conventions. Assuming a 3-dimensional reality, an example of a superdimensional occurrence would be something taking place partially inside a 4th or higher spacial dimensional.</p>
        <p>While most instances of magic are examples of superdimensional physics, not every one is. Realities may have standard subdimensional physics that explain that reality's magic. An example of this could be something such as a species with a chemical capable of controlled spontaneous combustions, providing the illusion of what some would call fire magic.</p>

      <div class="log" id="singularity">
        <h2>The Authours of Reality</h2>
        <p>Throughout every reality that Sci monitors, there are instances of consistent ties between them. One such consistency is that of a singularity. Every monitored reality, and likely every unmonitored reality as well, has one. A singularity is an entity, person or object, that has full control over said reality. Many times this may coincide with the authour of that reality, while that may not always be the case, especially if the reality in question does not have an authour.</p>
        <p>For safety reasons, it is advised that the S.P.A.C.E. do not get involved with singularities, since the side effects they cause, willingly or otherwise, may interfere with a singularity's intentions and cause negative repercussions for the team.</p>

      <div class="log" id="cards">
        <h2>Stacking the Deck</h2>
        <p>A mysterious deck of playing cards, generated on demand by some form of charm. They contain the following suits.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In black, hearts, depicted as a broken heart instead of a whole one.</li>
          <li>In black, eyes, depicted as an empty eye symbol.</li>
          <li>In blue, stars, depicted as a five pointed star.</li>
          <li>In blue, blades, depicted as a circle with a slash through the middle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interesting to note, the standard scale (as calculated from various constants) of this reality is significantly smaller than the average. The cards are estimated to be not much larger than a thumbnail in size.</p>

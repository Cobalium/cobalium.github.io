        <p>
          This information was chosen to be main public by a decision of higher level operatives.<br>
          Should further discussion of topics be desired, a sever channel may be created at request.

        <h2>The S.P.A.C.E.</h2>
        <p>The Severity Prevention and Correction Elite (S.P.A.C.E.) are Sci's own spec ops team. They are responsible for correcting any severe errors caused by interactions of multiple realites. Their methods, however, are not perfect, and may occasionally be seen as "plot holes" in certain media.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="log" id="boreal">
        <h2>The Boreal</h2>
        <p>We have reason to believe that light is not a substance on it's own, but rather, a state of matter acheivable by anything. The closed eye for the boreal has been aquired in order to gather information regarding this. To avoid confusion, the substance regarded as normal light should instead be called photon.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="log" id="glass">
        <h2>The GLASS Project</h2>
        <p>The leading members of The GLASS Project are responsible for the development of interspacial travel. Their last status was regarding issues in the stabalization of wormholes, or "flows" in their terminology. Due to such severe deviation from the original intentions of the project, termination of the project is very likely imminent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="log" id="ennead">
        <h2>Ennead</h2>
        <p>Ennead is used to convey information in a manner more efficient for small working spaces. It's primary components are a base rune and, in most cases, a dot, the exact depiction of these does not matter, so long as they're unique. Following is an example of text written with ennead.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/ennead-example.svg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Below is the basis for the construction of most ennead runes.</p>

      <div class="log" id="magic">
        <h2>Superdimensional Physics</h2>
        <p>While looking into various realities, a occurrence common across many, but not all, is that of magic. After study and reasearch we have decided that the distinction between magic and non-magic is better classified as subdimensional and superdimensional. Things that are subdimensional are what you'd expect to see, things that occur within normally accepted laws of physics within  a regular spacial volume. Things that are superdimensional however break these standard conventions. Assuming a 3-dimensional reality, an example of a superdimensional occurrence would be something taking place parially inside a 4th or higher spacial dimensional.</p>
        <p>While most instances of magic are examples of superdimensional physics, not every one is. Realities may have standard subdimensional physics that explain that reality's magic. An example of this could be something such as a species with a chemical capable of controlled spontaneous combustions, providing the illusion of what some would call fire magic.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="log" id="singularity">
        <h2>The Authours of Reality</h2>
        <p>Throughout every reality that Sci monitors, there are instances of consistent ties between them. One such consistency is that of a singularity. Every monitored reality, and likely every unmonitored reality as well, has one. A singularity is an entity, person or object, that has full control over said reality. Many times this may coincide with the authour of that reality, while that may not always be the case, especially if the reality in question does not have an authour.</p>
        <p>For safety reasons, it is advised that the S.P.A.C.E. do not get involved with singularities, since the side effects they cause, willingly or otherwise, may interfere with a singularity's intentions and cause negative reprocussions for the team.</p>

      <div class="log" id="eye">
        <h2>The Eyes</h2>
        <p>An eye is an object or entity used by Sci to look into other realities. An eye aware of its use as an eye should be referred to as open, while an eye not aware of it's use as such should be referred to as closed. Information from eyes is sent back to The Eye of Reality for cataloging and processing. A partial list of eyes follows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The GLASS Project</li>
            <li>S.P.A.C.E.</li>
            <li>Archaic</li>

        <p>Should you believe that one of the enteries referrs to you incorrectly, you may shortly be contacted about becoming opened.</p>
